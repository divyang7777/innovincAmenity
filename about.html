            <p>For almost twenty years, I&rsquo;ve been helping clients of all shapes and sizes create beautiful and usable things. Having started my career in print design, I learned how to design for the web and to code websites early on through professional experience and freelance work. I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with the best, at top design firms like <a href="http://www.happycog.com/" target="blank">Happy Cog</a>, <a href="http://www.muledesign.com/" target="blank">Mule Design Studio</a> and <a href="http://www.tangibleux.com/" target="blank">Tangible UX</a>, where usability and accessibility are top priority.</p>

                <p class="small-caption">TurboTax Usability Audit</p>
            </div>
            <p>I broadened my experience working as an in-house user experience designer at Radian, as an application design consultant at a couple early stage start-ups, and as a design consultant with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="blank">Facebook</a>. In each of these positions, in addition to designing, I&rsquo;ve conducted research and user testing to inform the user experience and site structure.</p>
            <p>In 2014, I decided to dedicate my professional time to working with my own clients. I love having the opportunity to learn about what my clients are passionate about, and to help them visualize what they&rsquo;d like to portray to their audiences. From sustainable flooring to wearable technology, non-profits to venture capital, and tiny start-ups to the biggest social network on the planet, diversity is what makes my job amazing.</p>
            <p>Not only are my clients diverse, but their projects are, as well. As an independent designer I can take on projects of all kinds, which allows me to tap into all of the experience I&rsquo;ve accrued through the years. I design brochures, menus, business cards, books, annual reports, Powerpoint and Keynote presentations, responsive websites, applications&mdash;anything my clients need. My professional partners (listed below) help me take on projects of any size.</p>

            <p>Working for myself (and omitting a commute) also allows me the opportunity to dedicate more of my free time to wildlife rescue and rehabilitiation, my second passion. I volunteer at the Marine Mammal Center, working with seals and sea lions; the Peninsula Humane Society, working with small mammals, songbirds, sea birds and raptors; and <a href="http://www.cawhalerescue.org/" target="blank">California Whale Rescue</a>, the official whale entanglement response network of Northern California, of which I&rsquo;m a co-founder, the Operations Coordinator, and a responder.</p>
